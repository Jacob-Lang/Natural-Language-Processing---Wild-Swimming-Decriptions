 Lower Buckton & The Millstream Camp ,Lower Buckton Country House & The Millstream Camp.  Stunning bed and breakfast in fab old farmhouse and unique Shepherd’s Hut with tipi for private glamping beside a babbling brook.  Off the beaten track in a tranquil rural setting on the north Herefordshire south Shropshire borders where England meets Wales.  Wild swimming in private millstream-pond at bottom of the garden or take yourself off along the riverside walks and dip in and out of the rivers Teme and Clun.
" River Teme, Leintwardine ","Nice quiet spot in the summer at the joining of the River Teme and River Clun for a swim or a paddle. The River Teme lazily winds it’s way towards the site through a lovely green meadow and is mainly warm, clear and shallow. The River Clun runs towards the site through a confluence and (I’m assuming) was used as the old mill stream."
" Bredwardine, River Wye ",In summer this is normally a lovely spot near the grand old brick bridge with gravel river beach to one side for a gentle swim in the River Wye.
" River Teme, Ashford Carbonel ",Look for the old schoolhouse on the left as you come into the (very pretty) village of Ashford Carbonel. You can normally park further along into the village nr the Village Hall. Almost exactly opposite the old school across the road is a small track with a ‘public bridleway’ sign and gate at the top. Follow the track down to the bend in the River Teme and Ashford Carbonel’s ‘beach’. The track (public bridleway) is apparently an access rd for a Severn Trent treatment facility which is further downriver from the swimming site around a large river bend.
 Wood of Cree – Newton Stewart ,"A beautiful burn located in an ancient woodland. There is a beautiful walk around the Wood of Cree with a chance to see interesting wildlife. The fauna includes Pied flycatchers,"
 Grey Mare’s Tail Burn – Galloway Forest Park ,"There are a number of small plunge pools on the Grey Mare’s Tail Burn. We swam in three different ones. All were Lovely. The highest up we went was the Grey Mare’s waterfall itself (GR492727). This can be walked to from the main road walking to the right of the burn up a steep hill cross a car track and continue for a 100m or you can drive and park higher up (off the car track) following signs for the Black Loch car park. We also swam in the Buck Loup plunge pool the one nearest the car park (GR491722), approach from right of burn across bridge. However, our favourite of the three swims was a smaller fall in between the previous two, just above the Buck loup falls. The access was slightly more difficult. Walk up the track up the hill to the right of the burn after about 100m you need to turn left leaving the main path weaving your way through bracken following small trails till you meet the burn. You come out just above a small plunge pool. Clamber down to for a delightful swim. Just below there is a small slide and further small pools. This could be the Foot loop on the OS explorer map (approximate GR492723)."
 Water of Minnoch – Glen Trool ,"A lovely waterfall right next to the visitor car park in the beautiful Glen Trool. The waterfall is visible from the road bridge. Two places to swim here one above the falls and one below. The pool above is easier to access and is slower moving. You can swim up under the bridge. To get to the pool below you have to climb down some rocks. Once in you can mess about in the small white water pool, swim in the current and swim downstream. Travel North on the A714 from Newton Stewart. Turn right to Glen Trool Village. There is a nice pub, The House O Hill, that does an excellent homemade burger. Turn right after the village sign posted the Glen Trool Visitor centre."
 Clugie Linn – Palnure Burn – Galloway Forest Park ,This swim is very close to the Grey Mare’s Tail Burn swims. You can park at the same place or if travelling South west towards Newton Stewart carry on a little way and turn left down track. Follow for 200m and park before bridge. The waterfall Clugie Linn is to left (upstream) of  bridge. The best way to enter the water is on the right hand side of river facing downstream just down from Bridge. You can have a nice swim up to base of waterfall. This is a less shady option to the Grey Mare’s tail Burn but in my opinion less beautiful. We only has a short swim here but there could be a possibility of jumps off some of the rocks on the side. Swim Location: Explore 319 487713.
 Meldon Quarry ,"Old water filled quarry, with swing rope on the southern side!"
 Lettermay Burn – Lochgoilhead – Argyll Forest Park ,"Loch Goil is just west of Loch Lomond just over an hour from Glasgow. Follow the old military road (A83) west of Tarbet up the pass to rest and be thankful (you can see why it has the name) turn left down the beautiful winding B828 descending into the secluded Glenn Mor and finally reaching the small town of Lochgoilhead. My wife, four month old son and I stayed at the Shore House Inn for a little treat after 3 weeks in our campervan. The room was beautiful with a great view of this long thin Loch. For the Wild campers there were a few spots along the Western shore of Loch Goil which was the location of a number of swimming holes."
 Water of Trool – Glen trool – Galloway Forest Park ,A quick dip near to the waterfall on the Water of Minnoch (see listing). Wasn’t very deep but with a bit of scrambling you could sit in a nice bubble bath. Park at the Glen Trool visitor centre. Walk down path along east bank of Water of Minnoch. Follow path until you reach the Water of Trool. Follow up Trool until you get to bridge by Black Loup labelled on OS explorer map 318 or 319. Swim Location GR 378782.
 Glen Orchy ,The River Orchy is a beautiful river in Glen Orchy east of Dalmally. It is popular when in spate with Kayakers and rafters but when lower provides some excellent swimming and river fun. There are four waterfalls where the current is fast but exciting for swimming (Use a buoyancy aid for extra safety). There are also a number of other places suitable for a calmer swim. We visit the river every day for 4 days and were still finding lovely spots to swim. Our favourites were by the waterfalls as the current provided an exciting challenge. We also Kayak down from the most famous waterfall Eas Urchaidh to Dalmally which was a very pleasant way to spend a few hours. The other waterfalls that were good for swimming were upstream. Two have names Eas Chathaidh and Easan DubhaThe river runs along the B8074 a single track road with passing places. We were staying in a cottage but the river is suitable for some wild camping. . We fell in love with this river and the swimming is some of the best I have experienced in the UK. We had many sunny days to explore it and I have never felt happier than the summer of 2012 spent in Scotland with my wife 6 month year old son and two friends and one of the major highlights was the River Orchy. Wonderful!

","A very fine 13th century mill,now a pub/restaurant,at the front is the sluice and its super for both paddling for infants with deeper cool chalk stream for swimming adjacent to a great grass park.limited free parking but there is usually some to be found 1 -2 minutes walk. just 10 minutes into Salisbury city center via an established path through the medieval water meadows."
 Downstream to Shillingford Bridge ,"Water shoes needed for the walking, unless someone can drive you. Go down Wharf Rd from Shillingford village bus stop to the steps by the boathouse. Entry is a bit weedy and I’ve been warned about glass from parties at the wharf – swim or float down to Shillingford Bridge – exit by the hotel (right bank) or just below the bridge (left bank). Walk back by the Thames Path"
 Carding Mill Valley Reservoir ,"Located a short stroll from the top car park at the National Trust’s Carding Mill Valley. The reservoir is accessed from a steep stone man-made “beach” area, and gets deep quite close to the edge. It’s shaded by silver birches and overlooked by the beautiful peaks of the Long Mynd. It gets the sun in the morning. It has wild swimming safety notices and emergency equipment, and NT rangers close by. A lovely place to swim."
 wallers haven between bexhill and pevensey ,Wallers Haven is a slow flowing river in East Sussex that can be around 15 feet deep in places with the edges of the river lined with reeds. This is a very remote area and I strongly advise you do not go alone as it can be tricky to get in and out in certain stretches of the river. however its worth the experience as it remoteness makes it a truly rewarding wild swim experience.
 Canyoning North Wales ,"Canyoning is travelling in canyons using a variety of techniques that may include other outdoor activities such as walking, scrambling, climbing, jumping, abseiling (rappelling), and/or swimming."
 Low tide window at Cot Valley ,"Swim with seals and shags at a dramatic but demanding location in post-industrial Cornwall. Follow signs for Cot Valley from the Cape Cornwall Rd in St Just in Penwith to the free parking. Unless it’s flat calm and you don’t mind swimming over boulders, wait until low tide +/- 1 hr when the sand is visible."
 East Beach ,"Great place for all ages!  Roped off area for the little tykes. For the more adventurous swim southwest under the rope, along the left side of the cove, lovely clear water that’s a magical shade of blue. Follow that left side and explore for hundreds of yards. Lots of little grottos and several smallish rocks to jump off (one with a sketchy rope swing–be safe!) The sun shines at the beach here from noon to sunset.  We usually don’t arrive until after five when everyone else is headed home.  Enjoy!"
 Kearne Bridge ,"There’s a canoe launch here that also makes a good spot to get into the river Wye, with free parking.  The get in can be silty, and the river bottom is stoney so water shoes are advised.  In times of low flow you can swim upstream and float back down.  You can also start a 2.2 mile swim or float down to Lower Lydbrook.  If you do this swim you’ll definitely want shoes as you may come across a couple of shallow rapids which you’ll need to walk over."
 Lower Lydbrook ,"There’s a small car park here (which closes at 8pm, £1 donation to park) with access to the River Wye.  It makes a good start point to swim down to Symonds Yat or a finish point from Kearne Bridge.  If you wade above the rapid the river pools and is suitable for a relaxing dip, or swim upstream.  Shoes recommended as it is rocky."
 Bredon ,"You can park here (free) and get into the river across the small grassy area.  The river can be busy with boats here so best early morning or in the evenings, though you may still sense a bit of a petrol coating on the water!  The river bottom is very silty so you may end up ankle deep in muck getting in and out."
 The Old Swimming Place ,"A large lawn for sunbathing and picnicking, and a gentle curve in the River Avon for swimming. This is where many older Stratfordians remember learning to swim."
 Island Picnic site Usk ,"Pleasant, gentle river swim. Use the Usk Island car park, just on the Pontypool Road out of Usk as you are leaving the town. (Gates locked at 8pm) Toilets are open"
" White Mill, Sturminster Marshall ","An unexpected dip (aren’t they always the best?) when the river was so enticing, just downstream from White Mill in the River Stour. A little weedy, but very pleasant swim with beautiful surroundings. Swans nearby so I’d be a bit more nervous during breeding season. I think a swim from here down to Corfe Mullen could be lovely, with obliging friends/family to meet you with dry clothes and follow with pub lunch!"
" Kailpot Crag, Ullswater ","A short walk along the footpath from Sandwick towards howtown takes you through some beautiful pine woods and some very pretty swimming bays. Keep on the path until you come to an open crag, (Approximately 1 mile from Sandwick) Quick change then jump in straight from the rock. Crystal clear clear water and boats gently passing you by. Beautiful. Note: the walk is shorter from the Howtown side but parking is harder."
 Finningley Quarry ,A series of disused quarry lakes just off levels lane. Extremely popular on hot days with hordes of local youths visiting and swimming and some of them jumping from the quarry face. The place is enormous though so there is plenty of room for everyone. Warning: the gates at the end of levels lane shut in the evening so park your car at the end. The footpaths remain open.
 Llyn Padarn ,"this may  not be secluded but is a beautiful place to swim. I swim here twice a week. You can take various routes either across or along or dip into the alleyways to the lagoons. it can be busy at weekends in the summer but if you swim in the middle rather than the lagoons it will be quiet. Surflines – the shop across the road has assisted swim available on weekends and also hire suits and canoes/kayaks. Plenty of parking, free near surflines but the car park closer to the village is pay and display. also has a free public toilet."
" Chilbolton, Cow Common ",Small but deepish pool (7ft) in a tucked away bend of the river. Shallow all around so not much opportunity to explore upstream and downstream but beautifully clear. Quite cold. Strong current but nice to swim leisurely against it without moving.
 Slater’s Bridge pool ,"A lovely, surprisingly deep pool on the River Brathay, between Little Langdale Tarn and Slater’s Bridge."
 Llyn Gwynant ,"Roadside Lake, with what the locals call Elephants rock on the far side."
